CHALLENGE ACTIVITY 2.7.1: Sphere volume.
Given sphereRadius, compute the volume of a sphere and assign sphereVolume with the result. Use
(4.0 / 3.0) to perform floating-point division, instead of (4 / 3) which performs integer division.

Volume of sphere = (4.0 / 3.0) Ï€ r^3 (Hint: r^3 can be computed using *)
